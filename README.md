The html file contains each US District Court boundaries, color-coded based off of the 'partisanship' of the district. 
This was determined by finding each judge appointed to the court, the partisan lean of the president appointing the judge (Dem vs Rep) and then comparing how many R vs D judges.
The information for this dataset was collected from the district court website, wikipedia, and uscourts.gov. 
This dataset and map was created by Connor Nisbet, you can reach me at cnisbet@princeton.edu or nisbetconnor@yahoo.com
